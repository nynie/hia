**Travel and Tourism**
Fast image recognition can be beneficial in tourism through safety measures and precautions, such as scanning suitcases or persons during customs at an airport or other places which require heavy security. Another way it can be useful is through cameras on dashboards of vehicles such as planes, cars, or boats -- it can be used to detect obstacles and notify the driver. A limitation of this, however, may be that the algorithm may detect objects that are not of use to the system and cause redundancies. A risk that follows may be that the system may not be as reliable as human sight/touch and more obscure objects may go completely unnoticed, thus inhibiting safety measures.

**Gaming and Entertainment**
Object recognition can be useful in the gaming industry for data collection purposes; whereby they can track player habits and use this information to improve their game. AI can also be advanced and adapted using this information, in order to more accurately replicate a real person's movement and therefore improving the realism of the game. A limitation of this may be that it may be difficult to implement in order to gather data real-time among other processes that occur as the player plays it. A risk of this may be that the algorithm may not be entirely accurate, and so changes made based on unreliable results can be largely detrimental if changes were to be made using this information.

**Education and Learning**
A benefit of image recognition would be the improved efficiency of learning. An algorithm can be made to scan a worksheet as a student writes in order to verify their working and provide corrections. This can be very useful for adaptable learning and allow the student to learn from their mistakes immediately. A limitation of this may be that a computer's response may not be as understandable for a student as it would be from a person, who could rephrase workings or show other methods. As a result, a risk may be that the program causes further confusion and difficulty.

**Transport and Navigation**
One benefit of fast image recognition in transport and navigation is the ability for a device to be able to track a person's location solely on the basis of their surroundings, whereby it can be related to a database like Google Maps in order to provide an accurate result. Another benefit may be through the control of traffic in areas in order to inform commuters of the best possible route. A limitation of a tracking system may be that if the person is in a remote area it may be difficult to provide exactly where they are. A risk of this may be that if a person decides to rely on this application they may not succeed.

**Medicine and Healthcare**
Fast image recognition could be used to identify foreign objects within a scan or an X-ray, which would be far more accurate than if it were done by  a human.  It could also be used to calculate large amounts of a substance, such as cells. A limitation may be that if there were a lack of data or an object is obscure, there is a risk of providing inaccurate answers and therefore causing harm to the patient.
