Abstract Thinking - how do you identify a palindrome?

Picture the word in your head, or write it out on a piece of paper so you can envision all the letters individually. In this case, 'racecar'.
Re-assemble the word so that the last letter goes first, second-to-last letter goes second, etc...
If all the letters match after being rearranged, then it is a palindrome.
''racecar''
''racecar'' (backwards).

2. Reverse the word so that it is backwards
3. Compare all the letters in each position.
4. If all the letters match, then it is a palindrome.
