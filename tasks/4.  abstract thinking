Abstract Thinking - how do you identify a palindrome?

Picture the word in your head, or write it out on a piece of paper so you can envision all the letters individually. In this case, 'racecar'.
Re-assemble the word so that the last letter goes first, second-to-last letter goes second, etc...
If all the letters match after being rearranged, then it is a palindrome.
''racecar''
''racecar'' (backwards).

An algorithm to indentify a palindrome
1. Enter the word, example, ''racecar''
2. Reverse the word so that it is backwards
3. Compare all the letters in each position.
4. If all the letters match, then it is a palindrome.

Research - examples of abstractions in computer science.
- a car, a very complex machine with a simple interface (steering wheel, pedal, gear shift)
- a game controller, with a few buttons, but a complex control mechanism
- programming languages, which translate into machine codes.
