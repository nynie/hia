The first step would be to define the function of petal and using that function to make the general shape of each petal that will be created
The second step is to use the petal function to define a new function with flower. When called upon it will use the defined turtle to create the set amount of petals along with their width and length.
The third step is to define the move function, this one is just to define which turtle and the length in which the turtle will move.
The fourth step is to start the program, the turtle will go around in 360 degrees on its current position creating the flower petals one by one.


code:
import turtle

def petal(t,d,a):
    for _ in range(2):
      t.fd(d)
      t.left(a)
      t.fd(d)
      t.left(180-a)

def flower(t, n, r, angle):
    for i in range(n):
        petal(t,r,angle)
        t.left(360.0/n)

def move(t, length):
    window = turtle.Screen()
    window.bgcolor("White")
    t.pu()
    t.fd(length)
    t.pd()
    t.ht()

sam = turtle.Turtle()

sam.speed(99)


move(sam, -150)

sam.color("black")
move(sam, 150)
flower(sam, 10, 40.0, 60.0)(edited)
