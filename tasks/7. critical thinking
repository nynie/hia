*“AI doesn't have to be evil to destroy humanity – if AI has a goal and humanity
just happens in the way, it will destroy humanity as a matter of course without
even thinking about it, no hard feelings." – Elon Musk*

The term 'artificial intelligence' is described as the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages. In other words, AI can do anything a human can -- just without the humanity. Now, what exactly is humanity? In the dictionary, it can be taken as two meanings, 'all of human beings collectively'; and, 'the quality of humane; benevolence'. Having taken these into account, if AI lack empathy and morality - can they really be considered evil? Even through something so inexplicably paramount as the eradication of the human race.
Considering this, if AI cannot be reasonably called 'evil', can they be called kind?
